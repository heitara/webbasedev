	|
	| By far the most common change you will need to make in this file is to change the last bean
	| declaration to replace the default SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler with
	| one implementing your approach for authenticating usernames and passwords.

			| DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are
			| using.

			| Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket.
